Right now, i'm just looking for ways to find secrets and public APIs used, simple



### List of public APIs to look out for in static analysis
- Listing out public API names to look for
- then lookup key structures and grep rules
- then lookup package names for each of these



# 
- So i have a bunch of code files, how to grep ALL of these to find secrets?
    - let's just focus on the code first
    - so which one is application code and which is dependency code?

- MOBSF gives out a big ass list of code, let's find something here
    - NO more using MOBSF to parse string, need to use apktool

- Do secrets just exist in code files? where else can i look?
- How to list all dependencies used in the app? Not in Manifest, should be in Gradle



# Hard-coded keystore found?
- com.coinbase.network/ca-coinbase.bks
- com.coinbase.network/ca-coinbase.jks
=> found it in 'unknown' folder with apktool, encrypted or whatever



# apktool
- unknown folder have properties file of packages, firebase for sure
- have bunch of resource folders, looks like just strings in all languages



# 
- Tried apkurlgrep to extract endpoints from APK files
